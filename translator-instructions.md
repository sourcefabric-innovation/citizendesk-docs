## Translator Instructions

This page is linked from our internationalisation platform, Transifex,
in order to provide a few indications to the translators

#### Hard returns in strings

Strings may have hard returns signs. They can be safely omitted in the
translation since they have no effect within the HTML markup.

#### Citizendesk or Citizen Desk?

Currently the correct way to refer to the product is **Citizen Desk**, not Citizendesk
